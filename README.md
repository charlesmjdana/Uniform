# Uniform
This algorithm is the result of 4 years of personal research on NP-Complete problems (here SAT)  
  
If you want to compile the SAT Solver: gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Ofast uniform.c -o "uniform"  
  
If you are into science fiction and/or blockchain: https://jheusser.github.io/2013/02/03/satcoin.html  
  
It is currently in revision process awaiting peer review for the MPC by Springer.
